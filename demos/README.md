## A Collection of Demos and Mini-Games Related to Iridis Alpha
While developing Iridis Alpha, Minter released mini-games and demos to friends on Compunet. These are collected at the [Llamasoft Archive](http://www.llamasoftarchive.org/oldsite/llamadloads.htm) along with most or all of his other released games for 8 and 16 bit computers.

Each folder here has an overview of the demo. Some of them are reasonably well commented.
